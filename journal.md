### 27/09 - Assignment 01

  My goal for this first assignment was to remix the piece My Boyfriend Came Back From The War, by Olia Lialina, published in 1994. Her original piece is about PTSD, and captures a very anxious stream of thoughts displayed onto numerous frames.

  While keeping the subject matter my own and focusing on my personal experience, I aimed to keep the same style: short, uncontextualized fragments of thoughts, cryptic pictures that fade into the background and, most importantly, parallel branches of inner dialogue.

  Remaking the piece turned out to be a bigger challenge that I thought since most of the functions she uses for the piece are now deprecated in HTML5. I especially had to come up with new ways to use subdividing windows, which led me to compromises: it is no longer possible to resize windows like in the original scene, but on the bright side, the "unresizable" frame progression enabled a new idea: a deconstructed image will slowly show up as the experience comes to an end.

### 27/09 - Jon Rafman

Dream Journal is the new exposition made by Jon Rafman, a Canadian multimedia artist from Montreal. Jon Rafman is known for bringing forward mysteries from the deep web. Dream Journal gives us an image of the internet that goes past the memes and other kitch social media aesthetics. It rather shows us the violent, disturbing, erotic, perverse and sometimes beautiful parts of it.

The piece is an hour-long video with an "impossibly long" story, accompanied by a track by Oneohtrix Point Never. The aesthetic is ambiguous, and esoteric. It goes in every direction and follows no apparent logic. However, the objects and actions are all very clear and understandable, and use what Rafman calls "the language of the internet".

The artist describes it as such: "it uses very primitive animation software, but with it, you can respond very quickly, like the way that the internet responds to culture and politics.".

His work touches the fast-paced and saturated world we live in: "in an age of ADD, there's a sense in which immersion speaks on a critical level to what is required to completely emcompass a viewer.
With BR, you're blindfolded. With IMAX theaters, you might have vibrating chairs... I'm reflecting a time in which one almost arrest the viewer in a violent way.".

### 27/09 - 4chan

http://boards.4chan.org

"4chan is the armpit of the internet."

"Consider a community that is founded on the premise of anonymity. That anonymity is of supreme importance and defines that community. That’s 4chan. The saying “it’s a trap”, began as a joke, because many of the anonymous users would post misleading titles that linked to severely taboo sexual images or something even worse."

"Without accountability, a community like 4chan is considered a cesspool for some of the vilest content on the internet. You may recall that several of the civilian shooters in recent years were linked to posts on 4chan that outlined their plans and even had attempts at humor."

"[...]4Chan isn’t one homogenous entity. Most of the trouble comes from its /b/ (random) and /pol/ (politically incorrect) boards, but even within these there are dissenting voices and differing opinions. On one thread someone can submerge a toad in vodka before cruelly tying it to balloons and launching it to the skies, while on another users can uncover the personal information of a man abusing cats and report him to the authorities."

### 27/09 Alone together

"We don’t seem to care what these artificial intelligences “know” or “understand” of the human moments we might “share” with them. At the robotic moment, the performance of connection seems connection enough. We are poised to attach to the inanimate without prejudice. The phrase “technological promiscuity” comes to mind."

"We insert robots into every narrative of human frailty. People make too many demands; robot demands would be of a more manageable sort. People disappoint; ro- bots will not. When people talk about relationships with robots, they talk about cheating hus- bands, wives who fake orgasms, and children who take drugs."

"These days, teenagers have sexual adulthood thrust upon them before they are ready to deal with the complexities of rela- tionships. They are drawn to the comfort of connection without the demands of intimacy. This may lead them to a hookup—sex without commitment or even caring."

"They say they used to talk to each other as they waited to give presentations or took taxis to the airport; now they spend that time doing e-mail. Some tell me they are making better use of their “downtime,” but they argue without conviction. The time that they once used to talk as they waited for appointments or drove to the airport was never downtime. It was the time when far-flung global teams solidified relationships and refined ideas."

### 11/10 - Assignment 02
Messenger in a Bottle

* subscribe to the new platform on Messenger. Only subscribed participants can send/receive random messages.
* write down a message as you would in messenger. Once you send it, it will be randomly sent
* the recipient cannot be in your friendlist
* you can only send one message at a time. Once it has been seen, you can send another
* you can also receive one message at a time. Once you see it, you are eligible for another one

For this assignment, I wanted to do something alongside the concept of the message in a bottle. A one-direction communication with no idea of the recipient. We talked a lot about posting and sharing to "the feed" being this intimate safespace in which we could share our intimacy from a safe (and curated) distance.

My piece could be described as a mix of messenger, chatroulette and 4chan. You can send a message the same way you do in messenger, although you can't see who will read it. You will only be notified that _someone_ has read it. On the other hand, you will be assigned messages.

While messenger (and most other direct messaging apps), you always have a good idea of who you're talking to, which is a good source of self-consciousness. If we add anonymity in the mix, then the things we'll want to share will change. Also, knowing that this is a one-way conversation will give nothing to lose for the sender, leading to raw honesty and, most probably, disgusting pulsions.

Being on the receiving end is a big gamble as well. People do know they're gonna stumble upon some sort of phallus in chatroulette; they know they'll have to dig through the shitposting on a 4chan board. But they still use there platforms. Some people, myself included, just love the thrill of curiosity, and digging through completely uncensored parts of people.

### 11/10 - Drawing Dynamic Visualizations (Bret Victor)

http://worrydream.com/#!/DrawingDynamicVisualizationsTalk

"Throughout the history of science, diagrams and graphs have been essential thinking tools. In the past, such visualizations were drawn with pen on paper, and could embrace the directness, freedom, and expressiveness of hand drawing. Most modern visualizations are programmed instead, where a single description can dynamically generate a unique picture for any dataset."

"Much of the effort in designing this tool went into designing a set of drawing actions ("primitive operations") that allows the artist to precisely and unambiguously express intent. The editor is intentionally not magical, and does not "guess" what the artist is intending to do."

"Is this "programming"? Sure. The artist is certainly creating a computer program. (I would deny that it's "coding", however, since the artist is not directly manipulating a symbolic representation, and what else could the word "code" mean? (I've heard people claim that it must be "coding" because code is being "created under the hood". This seems equivalent to the claim that drawing in Illustrator is "coding in PostScript". (It's not.)))"

"More to the point, the artist is indeed required to think procedurally. (But note that the act of drawing, like a procedure, is a step-by-step process.). The artist must also think abstractly (when designing loops and sub-pictures and such). Learning abstraction is no doubt a challenge for anyone, although the tool is designed to help make that challenge approachable. (See Learnable Programming for a dissection of many of the techniques used.)"
