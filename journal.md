### 27/09 - Assignment 01

  My goal for this first assignment was to remix the piece My Boyfriend Came Back From The War, by Olia Lialina, published in 1994. Her original piece is about PTSD, and captures a very anxious stream of thoughts displayed onto numerous frames.

  While keeping the subject matter my own and focusing on my personal experience, I aimed to keep the same style: short, uncontextualized fragments of thoughts, cryptic pictures that fade into the background and, most importantly, parallel branches of inner dialogue.

  Remaking the piece turned out to be a bigger challenge that I thought since most of the functions she uses for the piece are now deprecated in HTML5. I especially had to come up with new ways to use subdividing windows, which led me to compromises: it is no longer possible to resize windows like in the original scene, but on the bright side, the "unresizable" frame progression enabled a new idea: a deconstructed image will slowly show up as the experience comes to an end.

### 27/09 - Jon Rafman

Dream Journal is the new exposition made by Jon Rafman, a Canadian multimedia artist from Montreal. Jon Rafman is known for bringing forward mysteries from the deep web. Dream Journal gives us an image of the internet that goes past the memes and other kitch social media aesthetics. It rather shows us the violent, disturbing, erotic, perverse and sometimes beautiful parts of it.

The piece is an hour-long video with an "impossibly long" story, accompanied by a track by Oneohtrix Point Never. The aesthetic is ambiguous, and esoteric. It goes in every direction and follows no apparent logic. However, the objects and actions are all very clear and understandable, and use what Rafman calls "the language of the internet".

The artist describes it as such: "it uses very primitive animation software, but with it, you can respond very quickly, like the way that the internet responds to culture and politics.".

His work touches the fast-paced and saturated world we live in: "in an age of ADD, there's a sense in which immersion speaks on a critical level to what is required to completely emcompass a viewer.
With BR, you're blindfolded. With IMAX theaters, you might have vibrating chairs... I'm reflecting a time in which one almost arrest the viewer in a violent way.".

### 27/09 - 4chan

http://boards.4chan.org

"4chan is the armpit of the internet."

"Consider a community that is founded on the premise of anonymity. That anonymity is of supreme importance and defines that community. That’s 4chan. The saying “it’s a trap”, began as a joke, because many of the anonymous users would post misleading titles that linked to severely taboo sexual images or something even worse."

"Without accountability, a community like 4chan is considered a cesspool for some of the vilest content on the internet. You may recall that several of the civilian shooters in recent years were linked to posts on 4chan that outlined their plans and even had attempts at humor."

"[...]4Chan isn’t one homogenous entity. Most of the trouble comes from its /b/ (random) and /pol/ (politically incorrect) boards, but even within these there are dissenting voices and differing opinions. On one thread someone can submerge a toad in vodka before cruelly tying it to balloons and launching it to the skies, while on another users can uncover the personal information of a man abusing cats and report him to the authorities."
